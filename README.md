# Bretzel Earth

My submission for the <a href="https://jfig2024.icube.unistra.fr/concours_blender.html" target="_blank">2024 AFIG's Geometry Nodes contest</a>.

The result animation is available at this link: TODO

The goal of the contest was to propose a fully procedural geometry and animation with Blender's Geometry Nodes, starting from a simple bretzel 3D model. The core of my submission is a bretzel tree generator, with a focus on a plausible and pleasing growing animation. The Bretzel Earth was created as a context to grow these bretzel trees.
